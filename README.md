# 👋 Hi, I'm Adrián Flores Párraga

🎓 **Software Engineering Student at 42 Madrid** *Learning without teachers or classes — driven by practice, peer-to-peer collaboration, and resilience.*

💡 **From `malloc` to LLMs.** I started deep in the trenches of **C and Systems programming**, understanding how memory and low-level logic work. Now, I'm leveraging that foundation to dive into **AI Development**, **Automation**, and **Vibe Coding**.

My goal is to combine the robustness of systems engineering with the speed and creativity of AI-assisted workflows.

## 🧠 My Vibe: "Vibe Coding"
I believe in the intersection of human logic and machine efficiency.
* **Flow State:** Using AI as a copilot to prototype faster and iterate instantly.
* **Builder Mindset:** If a task is repetitive, I script it. If a problem is complex, I break it down.
